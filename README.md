# Inception
# DESCRIPTION
Small project to learn how to create 3 Docker Images: MariaDB, Nginx and Wordpress, without using the official one (so installing and setting your docker image from scratch), within the same Docker Compose.
The result should be a wordpress page located on localhost, with persistant volume on the machine for the database in case of a shutdown or the removal of the images.

# HOW TO USE
To run this project, just type make in the terminal. Tested on an Ubuntu 20.04 environment, you will need Docker and the makefile dependancies.
